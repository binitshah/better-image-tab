# Better Image Tab

BIT intends to improve the bare bones image tab that opens up when you click "open image in new tab". Features will include:
 - saving in multiple file formats
 - basic photo manipulation

And more as I think of ideas. If you've got any ideas, file an issue and mark it as a feature. Pull Requests are apprecaited, although I don't see this getting popular anytime soon as this is basically still an idea at this point. The code above is a quick demo put together for Mhacks Nano.
